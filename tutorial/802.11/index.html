<h3 id="dot11">IEEE 802.11</h3>

<p>
<i>libtins</i> has great support for the IEEE 802.11 protocol. Tools
such as those included in the <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/">
aircrack-ng</a> suite should be very simple to implement using this
library.
</p>

<p>
The whole protocol is implemented using a base class, <code>Dot11</code>,
which contains fields shared by every frame in it. Every frame type is 
represented by a certain class that inherits from it. 
</p>

<h3 id="management-frames">Management frames</h3>

<p>
Let's have a look at management frames, which are represented by the
abstract class <code>Dot11Management</code>. This class contains several helper
methods which allow you to search and add tagged options from the frame.
We'll take as an example <code>Dot11Beacon</code>, which is the class that
represents beacon frames:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
Dot11Beacon beacon;
// Make this a broadcast frame. Note that Dot11::BROADCAST
// is just the same as "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"
beacon.addr1(Dot11::BROADCAST);
// We'll set the source address to some arbitrary address
beacon.addr2("00:01:02:03:04:05");
// Set the bssid, to the same one as above
beacon.addr3(beacon.addr2());

// Let's add an ssid option
beacon.ssid("libtins");
// Our current channel is 8
beacon.ds_parameter_set(8);
// This is our list of supported rates:
beacon.supported_rates({ 1.0f, 5.5f, 11.0f });

// Encryption: we'll say we use WPA2-psk encryption
beacon.rsn_information(RSNInformation::wpa2_psk());

// The beacon's ready to be sent!
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Note that the above curly brace syntax used when calling 
<code>Dot11Beacon::supported_rates</code> will only work in C++11, the latest
C++ ISO standard. That method takes a <code>std::vector&lt;float&gt;</code> 
as its argument, so we're calling vector's constructor from an 
<code>initializer_list</code>. If we didn't use this feature, we'd have to
create a temporary vector, fill it in, and pass it as argument.
If you haven't checked out C++11, you should, it's awesome.
</p>
<h3 id="data-frames">Data frames</h3>

<p>
Data frames should be easy to deal with if you have a basic notion of
how higher protocols are encapsulated within <i>802.11</i>.
</p>

<p>
Let's asume we've got no encryption in our data frames. A <i>TCP</i> packet 
will look like this in <i>libtins</i>:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<div class="panel panel-default shrinked">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/dot11-data.png" alt="Dot11Data" />
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        A non-encrypted <i>IEEE 802.11</i> packet.
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Here, the <code>SNAP</code> class, represents the <code>LLC+SNAP</code> encapsulation.
You should only care about this structure if you're actually crafting
packets. While sniffing, you should always use the <code>PDU::find_pdu</code>
method template to find the layer you're looking for. Note that instead
of <code>SNAP + IP + TCP</code>, there might be just a <code>RawPDU</code> if the
data is encrypted. In order to create a packet like the one shown above,
you could do the following:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
// Yikes! Simple stuff :D
Dot11Data data = Dot11Data() / SNAP() / IP() / TCP() / RawPDU("Hallou");
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="decrypting-data">Decrypting data frames</h3>

<p>
<i>libtins</i> supports the decryption of <i>WEP</i> and <i>WPA2</i>(
both <i>AES</i> and <i>TKIP</i>) encrypted 802.11 frames. Of course, the 
library will not crack the password/<i>PSK</i> used to encrypt the 
packets, you need to provide it yourself.
</p>

<h3 id="decrypting-wep">Decrypting WEP encrypted frames</h3>

<p>
The <code>WEPDecrypter</code> class, which lies the namespace <code>Crypto</code>,
is the one that handles <i>WEP</i> decryption. You create an object of 
that type, add tuples <code>(bssid, password)</code>, and let it decrypt packets. 
Let's see an example:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
Crypto::WEPDecrypter decrypter;
// Packets sent to/from the AP whose BSSID is the one provided below,
// will be decrypted using the password "passw"
decrypter.decrypter.add_password("00:01:02:03:04:05", "passw");
// Just asume we get an encrypted frame from somewhere
Dot11Data some_data = generate_dot11data();
if(decrypter.decrypt(some_data)) {
    // Data was decrypted
    std::cout << "Data was successfully decrypted!\n";
}
else {
    // Data couldn't be decrypted
    std::cout << "Decryption failed!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Okay, the example is pretty straightforward. One thing I'd like to point
out is why would decryption fail? Imagining the <code>BSSID</code> associated
with the data frame was actually the one for which we provided a password,
it could have happened that after decryption, the checksum field in the
data frame was invalid. In this case, the <code>RawPDU</code> that contained 
the data, would be removed, so <code>some_data.inner_pdu()</code> would be 
effectively <code>nullptr</code>. I'll explain why does the class behave 
this way below.
</p>

<p>
In case decryption was successful, the <code>RawPDU</code> would be replaced
by a <code>SNAP PDU</code>, followed by whatever that packet contained. 
As an example, this picture illustrates what would happen if you 
successfully decrypted a TCP packet:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<div class="panel panel-default shrinked">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/dot11-decrypt.png" alt="Dot11Decrypt" />
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        The result of decryption applied to an encrypted packet.
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Note that everything that follows the <code>SNAP PDU</code> obviously depends
on the actual packet being decrypted. Moreover, if the data frame were 
not encrypted, or the associated BSSID was not the one given, the packet 
will be left intact.
</p>

<p>
If you read above and wondered why packets for which the checksum is 
invalid are modified, and the <code>RawPDU</code> which contains the encrypted
data is removed, then here's the reason. The situation given in the 
snippet shown a few lines up is not very common. If you want to decrypt
a packet, you are most surely taking it out from either your network
interface, or a pcap file. The <code>WEPDecrypter</code> class was designed to 
be plugged in between a sniffer and the sniffer callback. That can
be achieved using the <code>DecrypterProxy</code> class template. This is
how you'd do it:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
bool handler(PDU &pdu) {
    // process....
    return true;
}
// ....

// This creates a decrypter proxy class. 
auto decrypt_proxy = make_wep_decrypter_proxy(handler);
// Same as in the previous example.
decrypt_proxy.decrypter().add_password("00:01:02:03:04:05", "passw");

// Create a sniffer
Sniffer sniffer("wlan0", Sniffer::PROMISC);
// Sniff and decrypt!
sniffer.sniff_loop(decrypt_proxy);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The code shown above would be a more common situation in which you'd use
a <code>WEPDecrypter</code>. Let's analyze it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We define a handler function, called "handler".</li>
    <li>We create a decrypter proxy. The "auto" specifier, again a C++11
        feature, is used so we don't actually write down the type of
        that object which should be something like
        <code>DecrypterProxy&lt;bool(*)(PDU&amp;), WEPDecrypter&gt;</code>. 
        Yes, it's a long name, that's why I used that specifier. This
        proxy class implements an <code>operator()</code>, suitable to be used
        as the argument to <code>Sniffer::sniff_loop</code>. It also stores
        a decrypter, in this case a <code>WEPDecrypter</code>, which you can
        access using the method <code>DecrypterProxy::decrypter</code></li>
    <li>The same tuple <i>(bssid, password)</i> is added to the decrypter 
        held by the proxy class.</li>
    <li>A sniffer is created, which will interpret packets from the
        <i>wlan0</i> interface.</li>
    <li>A sniffing loop is started. This is where the proxy does its 
        magic. Instead of simply calling our handler, it will intercept
        data frames that, in this case, are sent to/from the AP identified 
        by the BSSID provided, and it will decrypt the content. When the
        "handler" callback is executed, you know that if the <code>PDU</code>
        argument is a data frame that should be decrypted, then it will
        be. Frames from BSSIDs other than the ones provided will be left
        intact, and you'll still be able to process them in the same 
        callback. Packets for which the checksum is invalid will be 
        discarded. This somehow explains the behaviour pointed out a 
        few lines up. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Using this design, when new decrypters are added, you'll simply chain
them all together and use a somewhat "decrypting chain". 
</p>

<h3 id="decrypting-wpa">Decrypting WPA2 encrypted frames</h3>

<p>
As from <i>libtins</i> v1.1, the library supports the decryption of 
<i>WPA2</i>(both <i>AES</i> and <i>TKIP</i>) encrypted frames. This is
done through the <code>WPA2Decrypter</code> class.
</p>

<p>
<i>WPA2</i> decryption is more complex than <i>WEP</i> decryption,
since you can't just pick a random packet and decrypt it. There's a 
handshake between each client and the access point in which some 
<i>nonces</i>, which are later needed during decryption, are exchanged.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the access point's <i>SSID</i> is required in order to create
the first set of keys(the <i>PMK</i>), so you have to provide that as 
well. The object will be analyzing beacon frames looking for that 
<i>SSID</i> so that handshakes performed against that access point can
be filtered using the appropriate <i>BSSID</i>. 
</p>
<p>
<code>WPA2Decrypter</code> will be looking for 4-way handshakes. Everytime
one is detected, the <i>PTK</i> keys are generated(the <i>MIC</i> in 
the handshake is verified), and from that point, every packet sent from/to
that client will be decrypted, just like <i>WEPDecrypter</i> does.
</p>
<p>
Let's see a small example on how to do this:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
bool handler(PDU &pdu) {
    // pdu here is not encrypted!
    return true;
}
// ....

// This creates a decrypter proxy class. 
auto decrypt_proxy = make_wpa2_decrypter_proxy(handler);
// Same as in the previous example.
decrypt_proxy.decrypter().add_ap_data("my_secure_psk", "my_access_point_ssid");

// Create a sniffer
Sniffer sniffer("wlan0", Sniffer::PROMISC);
// Sniff and decrypt!
sniffer.sniff_loop(decrypt_proxy);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="encapsulation">802.11 encapsulation</h3>

<p>
As you may know, network interface drivers typically use some form of 
encapsulation rather than using raw 802.11 frames. A widely used form
of encapsulation is the <code>RadioTap</code> protocol. If your driver uses
<i>RadioTap</i>, then a packet taken from it will look like this:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<div class="panel panel-default shrinked">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/radiotap-encapsulation.png" alt="RadioTap encapsulation" />
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <i>RadioTap</i> encapsulated <i>802.11</i> frame.
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The <i>RadioTap</i> protocol gives you more information about 802.11
frames. You can retrieve info such as the signal strength, noise, whether
a Frame Check Sequence is used to provide integrity, etc.
</p>
<p>
The <code>RadioTap</code> class uses some useful defaults, so you don't have 
to provide every option, since most of the time you'll use the same value
for them. As an example, this snippet:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <tins/tins.h>

using namespace Tins;

int main() {
    RadioTap radio = RadioTap() / Dot11Beacon();
    PacketWriter writer("/tmp/output.pcap", PacketWriter::RADIOTAP);
    writer.write(radio);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Generates the following packet:
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<div class="panel panel-default shrinked">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/radiotap-capture.png" alt="RadioTap Wireshark" />
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <i>RadioTap</i> packet generated with <i>libtins</i>, as displayed 
        by <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a>.
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Note that some drivers actually use raw 802.11 frames, without any 
encapsulation. Others may use <i>AVS</i> or <i>Prism</i>, but
unfortunately, <i>libtins</i> does not support them yet. However, adding
them is in the TODO list, so they'll probably be included soon.
