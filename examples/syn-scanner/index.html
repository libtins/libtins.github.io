<h3>SYN scanner</h3>

<p>
This is a simple <i>SYN</i> scanner. It takes an <i>IP</i> address and
a variable number of ports as command line arguments, and verifies 
if that host has those ports open or not.
</p>
<p>
This is done by sending <i>TCP</i> frames with the <i>SYN</i> flag
on. If the host's answer has the <i>RST</i> flag on, then the port is 
closed, if it contains the <i>SYN</i> and <i>ACK</i> flag on, then it's 
open. This doesn't take into account filtered ports, so you won't see 
any output for any ports that are filtered by some firewall.
</p>
<p>
One thing to notice is how sniffing is stopped. <i>libpcap</i>, which
is what the <i>Sniffer</i> class uses to achieve sniffing, can be stopped
using the <i>pcap_breakloop</i> only from the thread that is actually
sniffing. In most of the cases, this is completely useless, since
you are probably sniffing on one thread, and sending packets or 
processing them in another.
</p>
<p>
That is why applications that use the <i>Sniffer</i> class usually use
the same mechanism to stop sniffing: define a "special packet" that
will indicate that sniffing has stopped. You can also use some flag as
the return value of the sniffer functor, modify it when you're done and 
send a dummy packet so that the function checks the flag and ends. In 
this case, we use the first one, but generally the second one is simpler
to implement.
